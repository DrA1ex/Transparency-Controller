This is a simple transparency and style of Aero glass controller.
It's allows to you change the transparency for any active window by hotkey. You also can use the Aero Glass style to an any window, this is not always beautiful, sometimes terrible, but for some applications look well (eg cmd).
You can list the names of all the applications which Glass will be applied automatically.
Works in Windows XP (but it will be impossible to apply the Glass), and Windows 7 and Vista.

P.S. Sorry for my bad english.
